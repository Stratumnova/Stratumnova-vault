"I saw him walking backwards through a dry creek,  
dragging a line of ink that never broke.  
Every tree he passed turned to paper.  
He didn’t notice.

The sky folded in like a closing book.  
When it touched the ground, he whispered,  
'That wasn’t my name... but it *felt* like one.'

He carried no map.  
Only a page with a corner missing —  
torn, not cut, and still warm."
