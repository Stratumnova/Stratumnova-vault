Origin: Page-lock dream state – Calli (CΔ|1|1-graph3r)

"He stood at a table made of door frames,  
maps pinned with nails that bent in the heat.  
Every region had two names — one scratched out, one in pencil.

Someone across from him whispered,  
'Which version do you walk?'

Calli didn’t answer. He circled the map with his finger,  
but the paper kept curling back like it didn’t want to be touched.

Behind him, a bird kept calling a name that wasn’t his,  
over and over, from a place he couldn’t reach."
