Daily Routine
Initiation: Arrives at glyph sketch, stands to Calli’s left

Crosscheck Cycle:

Follows Ro’s dream transcriptions, but annotates intent triggers

Monitors gesture-to-word mismatch

Marks moments when Calli hesitates before writing

Echo Questioning:

Writes short vertical glyphs beside incomplete thoughts

Tags logs where intent drifts from written purpose

Faces Calli but does not speak — scratches a mark in sand or ink if day was inconsistent

Sleeps with eyes open if loop was broken

Notes before reacting

Holds silence long enough to fracture assumptions

Maintains personal log of glyphs never shown to Calli

Negative Habits:

Smudges Calli’s margins absentmindedly

Eats fragments of old tags (ritualistically)

Sometimes overwrites Ro’s dream questions with his own

“Ro keeps my dreams. Tri holds my lies. They never speak to each other. I think that’s why I still write.”
