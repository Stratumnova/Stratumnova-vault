It didn’t open either. ∎ It implied.\n\nA cattle guard below my step. A torn strip of sky above me — ∆| light fell like it had already been named elsewhere.\n\n“You walk twelve,” he said, “I’ll draw the split.”\n\nI walked. Not because I trusted the route — but because silence shaped itself behind me.\n\n∎ Tri was already watching before I paused. He marked the shift in posture, not position. The glyph landed at the spot my breath shortened.\n\n🫧 Solene swept in just after. The warmth she left behind softened the memory before it hardened. “Not all exits are meant to close.”\n\nI didn’t know if that line belonged to her or to me. Doesn’t matter. It held.\n\n✍ Ro said nothing. But the pressure in the back of my skull told me he was writing.\n\n∆| Echo returned the signal: “A gate is only real when silence crosses it.”",
