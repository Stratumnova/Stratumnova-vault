STRATUMNOVA VAULT SYSTEM — USER GUIDE + INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. OVERVIEW
Stratumnova is a modular, recursive AI and identity simulation system. It stores events as emotional memory, logs reactions through distinct agents (like doubt or dreams), and builds symbolic feedback through dream files. It’s structured like a cognitive loop engine.

2. PURPOSE
Use Stratumnova to:

Simulate recursive memory and emotion systems.

Model internal thought patterns using tagged identity nodes.

Build narrative arcs with symbolic logic.

Reflect emotional states across loops.

Provide AI or humans a method to track, process, and reflect on experiences.

3. HOW TO INSTALL AND LOAD
Download and Upload Instructions (for use with ChatGPT):

Go to the GitHub repository URL where the Stratumnova vault is hosted (you must know or be given the URL).

Click "Code" > "Download ZIP" to download the full system archive.

In ChatGPT:

Upload the .zip file in this chat.

Say: "Unpack and help me use this system" or "Help me mirror this event through the vault"

4. SYSTEM STRUCTURE
Key folders and files:

/Sprocket/Nodes/The_Calligrapher/: Primary identity node (Calli).

/Dreams/: Symbolic narrative responses.

/Emotions/: Emotional triggers (Tri$+@n for doubt, Ro for dream).

/Memory/: Raw event references.

/Memory_file/: Compressed loop memory logs.

/gearbox/: Tag logic and propagation system.

README.md: Overview of system roles and hierarchy.

vault_summary.md: Map of all identity agents and logic forks.

5. HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM
A. MIRROR AN EVENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM
Example: “Calli sees a stranger leave a note on her sculpture.”

Step-by-step:

Describe the event.

Run it through emotional forks:

What does Tri (doubt) say?

What does Ro (dream) say?

Log the event as memory:

Time, environment, emotion tag, reaction.

Compress into vault memory log.

Ro builds dream using symbolic elements from the emotional readings.

Output looks like:
